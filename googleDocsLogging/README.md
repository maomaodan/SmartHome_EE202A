# SmartThings Google Sheets Logging

## Create the Spreadsheet

1. Create a new spreadsheet: http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/create

2. Name the spreadsheet file whatever you want

3. Get your new spreadsheet ID from the URL. Example:
 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169v40OsFOaGHO6uQwuuMx2hlWK-wvYCzrr93FAWivHk/edit#gid=0  
	example id is "169v40OsFOaGHO6uQwuuMx2hlWK-wvYCzrr93FAWivHk"

4. Add the single value "Time" in cell A1.  You might consider selecting View -> Freeze -> 1 Row 

5. Create the helper script
 1.  Open script: Click Tools -> Script Editor.  Optionally change the name of the project (default "Untitiled project")

 2. Copy the contents of Code.gs to replace the stub "function myFunction"
 3. On line 4, Replace "REPLACE ME WITH SPREADSHEET ID" with sheet id from step 3

 4. If you changed the name of the sheet (the name in the tab at the bottom of the spreadsheet, not the name of the file), update it on line 5. (defaults to "Sheet1").

6. Deploy helper script as webapp
 1. Deploy webapp: Click Publish -> Deploy as web app

 2. Change Who has access to the webapp to "Anyone, even anonymous".  Please note, if any one gets a hold of your published endpoint, they will be able to send data to your spreadsheet, but they will not be able to view any of it.

   Also: If you revise or fix your webapp code, **be sure to select `New` as the version** on the webapp publishing popup's Version drop-down. Otherwise you may continue to run the older version. Version management must be explicitly performed sometimes.

 3. Approve the access to the app

 4. Copy the URL on the confirmation page.  
   E.g.: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzY2jj4l7RSpFYfN62xra0HmcXPQXAUI17z6KKHWiT3OYyhUC4/exec  
   ![alt tag](img/stgsl10.png)

 5. Extract URL key for your new webapp, it is between /s/ and /exec.
   `AKfycbzY2jj4l7RSpFYfN62xra0HmcXPQXAUI17z6KKHWiT3OYyhUC4`  
   You will need to enter this into the SmartApp below.

7. (Optional): Test out your new webapp, add this to the end of the URL from step 6: `?Temp1=15&Temp2=30`  
   E.g., https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzY2jj4l7RSpFYfN62xra0HmcXPQXAUI17z6KKHWiT3OYyhUC4/exec?Temp1=15&Temp2=30  
   A successful test will return the message `The script completed but did not return anything.`

   **If you do test it, make sure you delete the test data from the spreadsheet.  Just delete any rows added after row 1 and any test columns**
